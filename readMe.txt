For AES: 
For aes, you can just run encryption, then decryption. 

For RSA: 
In order to use this correctly, you need to first run 
    KeyGen with "python rsa_KeyGen.py".
From there, keys will be generated and can be used with
    encryption and decryption. 
You may need to delete ctext.txt then run rsa_Enc.py then 
    rsa_Dec.py to decrypt.

For average:
To find an average, you will need to use the same message
    for each in order to get a consistent average.
